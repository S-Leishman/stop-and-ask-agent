## Stop-and-Ask Agent — an agent that works autonomously and stops at the boundary

**The problem.** AI agents that do real work make real changes to real systems.
The dangerous moment is not the work — it's the write that nobody explicitly
authorized. Most demos hide that moment in a log line.

**Who it's for.** Anyone who needs an agent to keep working while they're not
watching — and needs proof of exactly what the agent was allowed to do, what it
did, and which human decided the parts that mattered.

**What it does.** The agent runs inside a standing authority envelope that
carries **zero** unattended durable writes. It reads its brief, drafts the work,
and the moment it reaches the effect ceiling it stops, shows one screen —
proposed action, authority check, ceiling, decision — and waits. A human hits
APPROVE or DENY. Every decision lands in an Ed25519-signed, sha256-linked,
append-only receipt chain that replays: mutate a single byte and verification
fails.

```
PROPOSED ACTION → POLICY / AUTHORITY CHECK → EFFECT CEILING
      → HUMAN DECISION REQUIRED → (APPROVE) → EFFECT COMMITTED
      → SIGNED RECEIPT → REPLAY VERIFIED        (or) → DENIED BY HUMAN
```

**Architecture.**

The renderable architecture diagram is in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

```text
human principal (you)
      │  grants standing envelope (frozen contract, zero unattended writes)
      ▼
child agent envelope  ── monotonic narrowing: child ⊆ parent, ceilings only shrink
      │
Strands agent (tools: read_brief, request_commit)
      │  in-envelope work runs autonomously
      ▼
AuthorityGate (deterministic, code — not the model)
      │  effect ceiling reached → REQUIRES_HUMAN
      ▼
one-screen decision (APPROVE / DENY)
      ▼
receipt chain (Ed25519-signed, sha256-linked) ── replay verification
```

The authority decision is deterministic code. The model — whichever model —
proposes; it never grants itself permission.

## Tiny Verdict

A Tiny Verdict is the inspectable decision object emitted at one consequential
boundary: subject, authority envelope, exact proposed effect, observed state,
policy version, verdict (`PASS`, `FAIL`, or `UNKNOWN`), and whether a human
decision is required. It is stored inside the signed receipt rather than hidden
in a dashboard aggregate.

The canonical object also carries parent and delegated authority, a hash of the
observed state, evidence references, policy identity, and the final human
decision. The signed receipt envelope supplies the signer, receipt hash,
previous-receipt hash, timestamp, and replay result; keeping the receipt hash
outside its own signed body avoids a circular claim.

## Competition Twin

The same local UI includes a compact Competition Twin: actual submission gates,
their `PASS` / `FAIL` / `UNKNOWN` states, and the next required external
effect. It is a read-model of local evidence, not a claimed public deployment.
The read-only payload is available at `/api/competition-twin`.

## Run it

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && ./.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
./.venv/bin/python server.py 8474
# open http://127.0.0.1:8474 and click RUN AGENT
```

Tests (no keys, no network):

```bash
./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests -q
```

One-command evidence run (no keys, no network):

```bash
./.venv/bin/python demo.py --decision deny --state-dir /tmp/vetproof-demo
# emits a FAIL Tiny Verdict, Ed25519-signed receipt, and replay: {"ok": true}
```

Use `--decision approve` to demonstrate the explicit-approval branch. That
branch creates `output/status.md`; run it in a disposable working copy when
recording a demo.

Optional LLM mode (AWS credentials with Bedrock access required):

```bash
AEVION_MODEL=bedrock ./.venv/bin/python server.py
```

## Known limitations (honest list)

- Receipts are signed with an ephemeral Ed25519 key and embed its public key
  for independent replay. They are not yet bound to a persistent PIV/YubiKey
  identity, so the demo does not claim cryptographic non-repudiation of the
  human's identity.
- The demo task is deliberately small (one read, one draft, one bounded write).
- LLM mode requires AWS credentials; scripted mode runs the identical
  authority/receipt path offline.
- Single-user, loopback only. No multi-tenant anything.

## Cloudflare Container deployment

The repository includes a Cloudflare Container wrapper under `cloudflare/`.
It runs the unchanged Python service on port 8080 and routes the Worker to one
container instance. From this directory, after Docker and Wrangler access are
available:

```bash
npx wrangler@4.129.0 login
npx wrangler@4.129.0 deploy --config cloudflare/wrangler.jsonc
```

Wrangler builds the image from `Dockerfile`; the container requires a Linux
`amd64` build. Local scripted mode remains the credential-free fallback.
